#print("") is an inbuilt function of python
print("Hello World!")
# "" is used to indicate str
# () are parentheses and values are placed inside it
# spaces are ignored but functions should be in all small alphabets
print("Hello \nWorld!") #to go to the next cell


#TYPES
#float , int , strings , boolean     (float=2.1 , int=2)  bool(1) is true & bool(0) is false
# to find the type - e.g: 10
print(type(10))
# example of how to convert from one type to another
int() #place value inside


#BASIC CALCULATIONS
# addition & subtraction
print(7+8)
print(8-3)
# ** is used for exponentiation multiplication
print(2**4)
# % is modulo (use for obtaining the remainders after division of numbers)
print(7%4)
# * is used for multiplication
print(3*8)
# / is used for division and the result is float
print(8/4) 
# // is used for division and the result is rounded up to int
print(5//2)


#INBUILT
# == is used to compare two data
# = is used as to assign values to variables
age = 16
# variables doesn't work inside "" and are taken as str
# input is an inbuilt function to make user interact
input ("")
# agrument is given inside the parentheses
#input is always taken as string by the language
#f str
print(f" ") # with variable inside {}
# if , else , elif , while (use : after these functions)
# if true : (if) , if false : (else)
# and , or , count/counter (count+=1)

#FUNCTIONS
